ZendR
<<<<<<< HEAD
================

A module for Zend2 designed to link PHP and R to generate detailed and complexe data reports, and much more.

What's in this repo?
-------------------

This repository contains all the files used to create an application in ZF2, including Twitter Bootstrap, Jquery, bower, etc.
It was created using ([Zend Framework Boilerplate 2](https://github.com/michael-romer/zfb2)). This might change over time, and future version of the repo might include only files from the module.

To-Do
-----
- [] Write a "wrapper" class that runs R scripts from PHP. We'll need at least:
	-- [] A function that displays R results properly
	-- [] A function that stores graphs generated by R and passes them through for display
- [] Write a class that generates javascript graphs
- [] Write a class that uses Doctrine entities and passes the corresponding SQL queries to R
